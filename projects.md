# Flow

An app that helps you track and visualize personal expenses. Written in Ruby on Rails. 

It was up on Heroku for a while, until I realized I was no longer using it consistently. The GitHub repo for Flow lives [here.](https://github.com/chrisaugust/Flow)

# Smore

A PERN stack app (Postgres, Express, React, Node) that enables users to track their work sessions across projects. Repo is [here.](https://github.com/chrisaugust/smore)


# Thousand Days

Commit to doing something every day, for 1000 days. [This app](https://thousand-days-frontend.vercel.app/) will help you track your progress. The backend API is written in Rails and hosted in an Amazon EC2 instance. The frontend is a Next.js React app hosted on Vercel. Learned a lot in the process of deployment!
