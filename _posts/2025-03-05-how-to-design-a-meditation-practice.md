title: "How to design a meditation practice"
---

A friend of mine recently asked me how I would spend my time if I had, hypothetically, 4 hours a day to devote to meditation.

My answer in the moment was kind of vague and hand-wavy. I said something about splitting the time up into concentration and insight practice. Not bad advice, but also not very specific. What exactly constitutes concentration and insight practices? And what's the point in dividing one's time between the two?

Let's answer that second question first. The reason to practice both concentration and insight is that the goal of (Buddhist) practice is to eliminate the existential suffering that comes from identifying with the body and the mind (self-view). Insight practice allows us to undermine the habitual tendency to feel ownership towards the body, sense perceptions, thoughts, and volition. By looking closely, we can see that these phenomena arise on their own (or rather, they come into being in dependence on a multitude of causes and conditions which are out of our control), they persist while conditions hold, and at a certain point they cease. By virtue of being 'conditioned' phenomena, they are bound to cease, whenever the necessary conditions no longer hold. Anything that arises in subjective experience is inherently 'un-ownable', and furthermore there's nobody and no 'thing' that *could* possibly own them.

To see this, and to experience it at a transformative level, requires a calm and concentrated mind. Thus the need for concentration practice. 

First you sharpen the sword of wisdom (concentration), then you wield it to cut through delusion and ignorance (insight).

On to the specifics...

With four hours to practice, I would do the following: 

30 to 40 minutes to establish mindfulness:
- mindfulness and investigation of the body -- body parts, elements, cemetery contemplation
- mindfulness and investigation of feeling-tones with a body scan  
- mindfulness and investigation of the mind and mind states -- hindrances, awakening factors

Bhikkhu Anālayo has a great guided meditation for this which I can highly recommend: [foundations of mindfulness (Satipatthanas)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpQ1moBuQX8)

2 hours fine material jhanas:
- 1st jhana: here's a link to Ayya Khema explaining how to access the [1st jhana](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDWo1w8BLhQ)
- 2nd jhana: and another link for [jhanas 2 through 4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_px1ma9bihE)
- 3rd jhana
- 4th jhana


1 hour formless jhanass:
- 5th jhana: boundless space; look for the boundaries of the body, and experience the absence of any such boundary
- 6th jhana: boundless consciousness; turn awareness towards that which is aware of boundless space

Returning to Bhikku Anālayo for his excellent guided meditation on the [gradual entry to emptiness](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVsVwr2gvzQ) for instructions on how to access the perception of boundless space and boundless consciousness.

After each jhana, reflecting: "this too is conditioned, fabricated, un-ownable, bound to cease, ultimately unsatisfying".

(this is as far/deep as I can go with concentration, but there are [additional jhanas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dhyana_in_Buddhism) to cultivate )

30 minutes:
Inclining the mind towards the Unconditioned/Deathless, that from which conditioned phenomena arise, and to which they return
