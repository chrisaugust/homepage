Turns out, setting up Jekyll was easy! What was tricky was knowing what to ignore from the old setup. There was a CNAME record that I wasn't sure how to deal with... And for some reason the changes I had made to the Jekyll project in an attempt to run it on Heroku was interfering with proper display of styles, as well as directory structure for posts. Broken left and right.

As it goes for many of my projects, I just had to start from a clean slate. 

Deleted my local and remote repos, and started over from scratch. After configuring GitHub Pages to use Jekyll, and pointing it to my domain name, it created the necessary CNAME file. And the weird styling issue (or rather lack of styling) that was occurring earlier is fixed. Cool cool cool.  

Oh, I also made a fun logo to use for the homepage, using a toy JavaScript app (doodlepad) I made a while back. Now I just need to figure out how to get it to show up in the template for the main page...
