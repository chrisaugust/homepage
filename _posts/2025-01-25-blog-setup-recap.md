Turns out, setting up Jekyll was easy! What was tricky was knowing what to ignore from the old setup. I had previously been running a static site which made use of a CNAME record (why this was necessary and how it all works is still very fuzzy for me), and this wasn't necessary for using Jekyll with GitHub Pages.

As it goes for many of my projects, I just had to start from a clean slate. 

Deleted my local and remote repos, started from scratch, and everything worked. Cool cool cool. 

Oh, and I made a fun logo to use for the homepage. Now I just need to figure out how to get it to show up in the template for the main page...
