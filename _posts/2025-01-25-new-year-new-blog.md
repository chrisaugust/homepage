title: "New year, new blog"

I've decided yet again to add a blog to my website. Instead of 'rolling my own', it makes sense to use an existing solution. This blog is built with Jekyll, a so-called Static Site Generator, or SSG, which is an application that pre-compiles the blog into static HTML pages.

So far the process has been harder than anticipated. I'm in the middle of slogging through it right now, and I can't figure out what I'm doing wrong exactly. Once everything is up on the web, I'll circle back and do a recap.

In the meantime, it's the weekend! Hopefully we all get outside for a bit, catch some sunshine, and enjoy being alive!
